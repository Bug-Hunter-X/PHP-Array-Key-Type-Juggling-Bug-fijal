This code suffers from a subtle bug related to how PHP handles array keys.  When you use a non-integer value as an array key, it's implicitly cast to a string. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful, especially when comparing keys.

```php
<?php
$arr = ['1' => 'one', 1 => 'two'];

if (array_key_exists('1', $arr)) {
  echo "Key '1' exists\n";
}

if (array_key_exists(1, $arr)) {
  echo "Key 1 exists\n";
}

var_dump($arr);
?>
```

The `array_key_exists` function will show that both keys exist.  However, it shows that the value associated with the key `1` is `two`, and not `one`. This is because PHP treats the string key '1' and the integer key 1 as distinct.

Another subtle issue can arise when using floating-point numbers as array keys. These are converted to string representation before being used as keys, which could lead to unexpected behavior or difficult debugging in certain scenarios.
